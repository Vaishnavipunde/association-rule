Problem Statement: - 
A Mobile Phone manufacturing company wants to launch its three brand new phone into the market, but before going with its traditional marketing approach this time it want to analyze the data of its previous model sales in different regions and you have been hired as an Data Scientist to help them out, use the Association rules concept and provide your insights to the companyâ€™s marketing team to improve its sales.

1.1.	What is the business objective?
  Identifying Purchase Patterns,Optimizing Marketing Strategies
1.2.	Are there any constraints?
  Data Quality and Availability,privacy
1.3 Write about the benefits/impact of the solution - in what way does the business (client) benefit from the solution provided?
   Cost-effective
